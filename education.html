                <p>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali is one of the Seven IISERs all across India. IISERs are autonomous institutions in India that teach and conduct research in natural sciences. The Government of India established the IISERs through the Ministry of Education.
                I got admission to the Dual Degree program by clearing the JEE Advanced 2020.
                Further information about this institution can be found on this <a href="https://www.iisermohali.ac.in" target="_blank">link</a>

                                            <li>ntroduction Quantum theory (QT) is empirically a very successful theory;
                                                there is however an apparent lack of understanding of the theory. This
                                                is mostly due to the fact that, unlike the space-time structure, the cut
                                                between the ontology and epistemology in QT is difficult to resolve. The
                                                two fundamental concepts–the nonlocal correlations (entanglement)
                                                between space-like separated systems and the indistinguishability
                                                (non-orthogonality) of quantum states–is widely believed to separate QT
                                                from classical theories. In this course we take a foundational approach
                                                to QT from the outside: i.e., since classical theories are completely
                                                devoid of entanglement, it is compared with various foil theories that
                                                are also nonlocal and indistinguishable in the sense of QT, such that
                                                their special nature in the theory can be quantified. The two concepts
                                                will be explained in this course through the variety of topics it has
                                                motivated in the field of quantum information and computation, or vice
