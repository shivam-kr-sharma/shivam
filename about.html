                Hi! my name is Shivam Kumar. I am pursuing my Integrated MSc course in Physics at IISER Mohali.
                I will get my Master's degree in Physics with a minor in Data Science in May 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am originally from a small city Barh, which is situated on the banks of the holy river Ganga, in Patna district of the state Bihar, India.
                I spent my whole childhood in Barh and completed my schooling from Adarsha Gyanodaya Vidyalaya Barh, Patna. I studied here up to class 10th (secondary school). For studies of Class XI and Class XII (Higher Secondary Certificate), I took admission in Anugraha Narayan Singh College Barh, Patna.
                After that, I took a drop of one year to prepare for entrance examinations of various research and engineering institutions across India. This is how I ended up in IISER Mohali.

                    <figcaption>IISER Mohali Campus</figcaption>
                </figure>
                I have been fortunate to immerse myself in a vibrant academic environment at IISER Mohali. My experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for collaborative research and innovative thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I enjoy coding in Python, designing tools, and creating simulations to aid research and visualization. My coding endeavors often complement my research, helping me analyze data and develop intuitive visual representations of complex quantum phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
                In sports, my favorite is cricket. I also play chess, badminton, and table tennis. I like Indian classical music, especially Sitar.
            </p>
            <p class="about-images">
                I am also interested in world politics and economics, and their impact on society. I am fascinated by how strongly the world politics and GDP or the stock market functioning of that country is correlated.

            <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe in the power of curiosity and persistence. Whether it's solving any experimental problem in the lab, or any complex quantum mechanics problems or writing any code, I approach challenges with enthusiasm and determination. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving frontier of quantum science while inspiring others to explore the boundless possibilities of research.

            <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
            <p>
                When I’m not delving into quantum physics, you can find me exploring new programming techniques, engaging in creative projects, or simply enjoying moments of reflection in nature. I firmly believe that a well-rounded perspective is key to achieving excellence in any field.
